# Usage
This example can be ran by executing ```make run``` after one has made sure the path to the [Bare-Metal Programming Toolkit](https://github.com/wovo/bmptk) and COM-port of the Arduino Due have been set according to your installation.

### Behaviour
The LED of the Arduino Due blinks fast when all tests were succesful and blinks slow when at least one test failed.
